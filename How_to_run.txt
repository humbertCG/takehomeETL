To run the code, you must install the latest version from python3 from https://www.python.org/downloads/

Once you are done with the installing process you are ready to execute the program, all you need to do is follow these steps:

Prerequisite: Check that the instances of postgreSQL and SQS are running locally this can be done by reveiwing the instruction of Data Takehome Test (This assignment)

1. Make sure that the directory that contains all the files is in a place that can be accesed easily through the cmd e.g C:\Users\YourUserName\scriptDirectory. 
You can use the file explorer/finder and/or terminal of your system for relocating the file.

2. Open the terminal you can type command prompt on the search bar or if you are on windows, you can press (win key + r) then type cmd, (on Mac you can press command + space and then type terminal) and 
finally hit enter. 

3. Before executing the program it is necessary to install the libraries that it requires to work appropiately. Navigate to the directory
   (issuing commands or by copying and pasting the path of the directory into the terminal preceded by the cd command) to the directory that contains
   the folders src, stubs, and dockerfiles; do not navigate into src yet! if you have installed python issue the following command to install the 
   requirements file: 
   
   pip3 install -r requirements.txt

4. Navigate (issuing commands or by copying and pasting the path of the directory into the terminal preceded by the cd command) to the location of the
script, make sure that you are inside the src folder. 

5. Execute the command: python3 ETLCustomer.py


6. Sit back and relax while tedious work is done automatically.
